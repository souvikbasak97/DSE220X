### Course introduction
This course is an intensive introduction to the most widely-used machine learning methods. The first goal is to provide a basic intuitive 
understanding of these techniques: what they are good for, how they work, how they relate to one another, and their strengths and
weaknesses. The second goal is to provide a hands-on feel for these methods through experiments with suitable data sets, using Jupyter 
notebooks. The third goal is to understand machine learning methods at a deeper level by delving into their mathematical underpinnings. 
This is crucial to being able to adapt and modify existing methods and to creatively combining them.  

### Course overview  

Topics:  

* Taxonomy of prediction problems  
* Nearest neighbor methods and families of distance functions  
* Generalization: what it means; overfitting; selecting parameters using cross-validation  
* Generative modeling for classification, especially using the multivariate Gaussian  
* Linear regression and its variants  
* Logistic regression  
* Optimization: deriving stochastic gradient descent algorithms and testing convexity  
* Linear classification using the support vector machine  
* Nonlinear modeling using basis expansion and kernel methods  
* Decision trees, boosting, and random forests  
* Methods for flat and hierarchical clustering  
* Principal component analysis  
* Autoencoders, distributed representations, and deep learning  

## Comments

I audited this course in April 2020 and completed the course.This is one of the best online course in ML as it maintains the right 
balance between learning and application of machine learning.I completed all the assignments and quizzes and uploaded the assignements
as proof of completing the course.Furthermore the solutions provided are to the best of my knowledge and while they might not be the most
efficient ones they are most probably correct.    Feel free to fork this repository and send a pull request in case of any errors or a more 
efficient solution.
